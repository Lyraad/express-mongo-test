A test of writing a NodeJs/Express backend in Typescript that will connect to a cloud mongoDB

Requires a Mongo Database:

Add databse details to /config/database.config.template and rename removing the .template

EG: /config/database.config.ts for dev/pre-build

Will initially be used with my React Message Board learning app
https://github.com/Lyraad/react-typescript-learning

But may be forked and adapted to work with other/future projects
